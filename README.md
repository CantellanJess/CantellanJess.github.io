# snapprojectassessment.github.io

My first attempt at publishing a project onto GitHub Pages. 
At first this was not easy but I managed to figure out a solution to the problem. 

This is my Snap Project Assessment. Based on one of my co workers businessess. At the moment she does not
have any website for her business, as well she does not currently have a way to properly take orders online. Which is why for now the nav 
leads only to a google sheet. 
This is not an official website.
